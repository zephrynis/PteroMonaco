2. Grant of License
	Subject to Your continued compliance with this License:
	a) You are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license for Internal Use of the Software (including production use and commercial operation for Your own services) and to create Derivative Works for Internal Use.
	b) You may make a reasonable number of backup and archival copies (kept strictly internal and protected from unauthorized access).
	c) You may configure, adapt, and integrate the Software internally. All Derivative Works remain subject to Section 3.

			ii. Providing installers, archives, images, containers, or deployment packages to third parties.
			iii. Sublicensing, leasing, renting, selling, transferring, or otherwise conveying any rights (except that reasonable internal contractor access under confidentiality is permitted).
	3.3 Permitted Hosted Access: Allowing third parties to interact with functionality powered by the Software exclusively via network interfaces (e.g., web UI, API) where they receive no copy of Software or derivative code does NOT constitute Redistribution.
	3.4 Derivative Works must: (a) remain internal; (b) retain all proprietary notices of Licensor in original files; (c) clearly mark modified sections; (d) not remove or alter this License notice.
	3.5 No Circumvention: You shall not obfuscate or compartmentalize Distribution to evade the Redistribution prohibition.

	The Software and all intellectual property rights therein remain the exclusive property of Licensor. Except for the limited license expressly stated, no rights (including any patent, trademark, or trade secret rights) are granted by implication, estoppel, or otherwise. All rights not expressly granted are reserved.

5. Updates and Patches
	Any update, fix, patch, or enhancement provided by Licensor is deemed part of the Software and governed by this License unless expressly stated otherwise in writing.

7. Term and Termination
	7.1 Term: This License remains effective until terminated.

	7.3 Post-Termination: Upon termination, You must cease all use, and destroy or permanently delete all copies and Derivative Works (except internal records strictly necessary for legal compliance), and certify destruction upon request.
	7.4 Survival: Sections 3–4, 6–9, 11–16 survive termination.

8. Revocability
	Licensor reserves the right to revoke this License for unremedied breach or to prevent ongoing infringement or misuse.

9. Confidentiality (Limited)
	The Software (including structure, organization, and code) is Licensor confidential information. You must protect it using at least reasonable care and may disclose it only to personnel with a need to know under confidentiality obligations no less protective.

10. Disclaimer of Warranties
	THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, LICENSOR DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, OR THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE.

11. Limitation of Liability
	TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW: (a) LICENSOR WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES; (b) LICENSOR'S TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SOFTWARE SHALL NOT EXCEED USD $100 (OR, IF GREATER, THE AMOUNT YOU ACTUALLY PAID LICENSOR FOR THE SOFTWARE, IF ANY). THESE LIMITATIONS APPLY EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND REGARDLESS OF THEORY OF LIABILITY.

12. Injunctive Relief
	Unauthorized Redistribution or breach of Sections 3, 4, 9 would cause irreparable harm for which monetary damages are inadequate. Licensor may seek immediate injunctive or equitable relief without posting bond (unless required by law) in addition to other remedies.

13. Export; Compliance

	You may not assign or transfer this License (by merger, acquisition, operation of law, or otherwise) without Licensor's prior written consent; any unauthorized assignment is void. Licensor may assign without restriction.

15. Severability; Waiver
	If any provision is held unenforceable, it will be modified to the minimum extent necessary to be enforceable while preserving intent; the remainder remains in effect. Failure to enforce any provision is not a waiver.

16. Entire Agreement; Amendments
	This License constitutes the entire agreement concerning the Software and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous understandings. Amendments must be in a signed writing (electronic signature acceptable). Purchase orders or other documents do not modify or add terms unless expressly agreed in writing by Licensor.

17. Governing Law; Venue
	This License is governed by the laws of the jurisdiction of Licensor (excluding conflict rules). Exclusive venue for disputes shall be the courts of that jurisdiction, and You consent to personal jurisdiction there (without limiting Licensor's right to seek relief elsewhere for injunctive or enforcement purposes).
